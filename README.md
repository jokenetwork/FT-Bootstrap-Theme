A simple Bootstrap theme for one-page/hero sites, which looks and feels great on mobile and on desktop, built with mobile-first in mind.

FT Bootstrap Theme was created for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) (**v5.0.2**+, but it's downwards compatible until **v3.3.4**) and while it is recommended, you don't even have to include Bootstrap to use this theme (It works stand-alone).

### Appearance
![Fully customizable appearance on mobile as well as on desktop.](https://jokenetwork.de/git/img/screenshot.png)
While the theme itself only comes in grey and orange, you can fully customize the experience of it as seen in this screenshot. 

#### Demo
You can see the theme in action [here](https://brembeck.me) or view the uncostumized project [here](https://home-5003623867.app-ionos.space).

### Usage
Basically, you can just start right away by downloading the code or cloning this git repository, as all used tools are included. 

I'd recommend to use Sublime Text for editing / changing files within this project.
